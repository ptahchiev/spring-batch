	<title>JSR-352 Support</title>

	<para>As of Spring Batch 3.0 support for JSR-352 has been fully implemented. This section is not a replacement for
        the spec itself and instead, intends to explain how the JSR-352 specific concepts apply to Spring Batch.
        Additional information on JSR-352 can be found via the
        JCP here: <ulink url="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352">https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352</ulink></para>

    <section id="jsrGeneralNotes">
        <title>General Notes Spring Batch and JSR-352</title>

        <para>Spring Batch and JSR-352 are structurally the same.  They both have jobs that are made up of steps.  They
            both have readers, processors, writers, and listeners.  However, their interactions are subtly different.
            For example, the <code>org.springframework.batch.core.SkipListener#onSkipInWrite(S item, Throwable t)</code>
            within Spring Batch receives two parameters: the item that was skipped and the Exception that caused the
            skip.  The JSR-352 version of the same method
            (<classname>javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.SkipWriteListener#onSkipWriteItem(List&lt;Object&gt; items, Exception ex)</classname>)
            also receives two parameters.  However the first one is a <classname>List</classname> of all the items
            within the current chunk with the second being the <classname>Exception</classname> that caused the skip.
            Because of these differences, it is important to note that there are two paths to execute a job within
            Spring Batch: either a traditional Spring Batch job or a JSR-352 based job.  While the use of Spring Batch
            artifacts (readers, writers, etc) will work within a job configured via JSR-352's JSL and executed via the
            <classname>JsrJobOperator</classname>, they will behave according to the rules of JSR-352.  It is also
            important to note that batch artifacts that have been developed against the JSR-352 interfaces will not work
            within a traditional Spring Batch job.</para>

        <title>Dependency Injection</title>

        <para>JSR-352 is based heavily on the Spring Batch programming model.  As such, while not explicitly requiring a
            formal dependency injection implementation, DI of some kind implied.  Spring Batch supports all three
            methods for loading batch artifacts defined by JSR-352:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Implementation Specific Loader - Spring Batch is built upon Spring and so supports Spring
                    dependency injection within JSR-352 batch jobs.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Archive Loader - JSR-352 defines the existing of a batch.xml file that provides mappings between a
                    logical name and a class name.  This file must be found within the /META-INF/ directory if it is
                    used.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Thread Context Class Loader - JSR-352 allows configurations to specify batch artifact
                    implementations in their JSL by providing the fully qualified class name inline.  Spring Batch
                    supports this as well in JSR-352 configured jobs.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>To use Spring dependency injection within a JSR-352 based batch job consists of configuring batch
            artifacts using a Spring application context as beans.  Once the beans have been defined, a job can refer to
            them as it would any bean defined within the batch.xml.</para>

    &lt;bean id="fooBatchlet" class="io.spring.FooBatchlet"&gt;

        &lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;/job&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;
        </programlisting>

        <para>The assembly of Spring contexts (imports, etc) works with JSR-352 jobs just as it would with any other
            Spring based application.  The only difference with a JSR-352 based job is that the entry point for the
            context definition will be the job definition found in /META-INF/batch-jobs/.</para>

        <para>To use the thread context class loader approach, all you need to do is provide the fully qualified class
            name as the ref.  It is important to note that when using this approach or the batch.xml approach, the class
            referenced requires a no argument constructor which will be used to create the bean.</para>

            <para>JSR-352 allows for properties to be defined at the Job, Step and batch artifact level by way of

        <section id="jsrBatchPropertyAnnotation">
            <title><classname>@BatchProperty</classname> annotation</title>

            <para>Properties are referenced in batch artifacts by annotating class fields with the
                <classname>@BatchProperty</classname> and <classname>@Inject</classname> annotations (both annotations
                are required by the spec). As defined by JSR-352, fields for properties must be String typed. Any type
                conversion is up to the implementing developer to perform.</para>

            <para>An <classname>javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemReader</classname> artifact could be configured with a

                <classname>checkpoint-policy</classname> as item (this is the default).

            <title>Custom checkpointing</title>
            <para>JSR-352 calls the process around the commit interval within a step "checkpointing".  Item based
                checkpointing is one approach as mentioned above.  However, this will not be robust enough in many
                cases.  Because of this, the spec allows for the implementation of a custom checkpointing algorithm by
                implementing the <classname>javax.batch.api.chunk.CheckpointAlgorithm</classname> interface.  This
                functionality is functionally the same as Spring Batch's custom completion policy.  To use an
                implementation of <classname>CheckpointAlgorithm</classname>, configure your step with the custom
                <classname>checkpoint-policy</classname> as shown below where fooCheckpointer refers to an

        <title>Step Flow</title>
        <para>Within a JSR-352 based job, the flow of steps works similarly as it does within Spring Batch.
            However, there are a few subtle differences:</para>

                    <para>Decision's are steps - In a regular Spring Batch job, a decision is a state that does not
                        have an independent <classname>StepExecution</classname> or any of the rights and
                        responsibilities that go along with being a full step..  However, with JSR-352, a decision
                        is a step just like any other and will behave just as any other steps (transactionality,
                        it gets a <classname>StepExecution</classname>, etc).  This means that they are treated the
                        same as any other step on restarts as well.</para>

                        same step with the next attribute taking precedence in evaluation.</para>

                            array of <classname>Properties</classname> providing the meta-data for each partition.

                            provides a collection of other components for the ability to provide compensating logic when
                            errors occur and to dynamically set the exit status.  These components include the following:

        <para>Since all JSR-352 based jobs are executed asynchronously, it can be difficult to determine when a job has
            completed.  To help with testing, Spring Batch provides the
            <classname>org.springframework.batch.core.jsr.JsrTestUtils</classname>.  This utility class provides the
            ability to start a job and restart a job and wait for it to complete.  Once the job completes, the
            associated <classname>JobExecution</classname> is returned.</para>
